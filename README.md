A fictional food manufacturer's website developed using React and Chakra UI. The website features a dynamic product page with a grid layout, allowing users to browse various food products and filter them by categories. Each product can be explored in more detail through a modal that appears when the 'Learn More' button is clicked. The site demonstrates the integration of modern UI/UX practices and responsive design.
